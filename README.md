Random Forest Regression is used to predict a startup’s success metrics, such as profit or valuation, based on historical data.
It works by building multiple decision trees and averaging their outputs for more accurate predictions.
This method reduces overfitting compared to a single decision tree, improving reliability.
Key input features often include R&D spending, marketing budget, location, and operational costs.
The model helps investors and founders make data-driven decisions by forecasting future performance.
